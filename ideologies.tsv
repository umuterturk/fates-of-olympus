Law of Order	Nomos	Nomos of the Unbroken Scale	All strength must answer to measure.	Nomos declares that Fate faltered because power exceeded its proper place. Balance is not hoped for; it is enforced through law, proportion, and strict structure. Order rewards alignment, exactness, and controlled outcomes—repairing the world by making it predictable and legible.	Exact-count conditions; lane rules; power normalization; silence/deny ongoing; buffs tied to formation/fullness/solitude; deterministic targeting and thresholds.	Control; hierarchy; symmetry; discipline; civic authority; the Olympian impulse to legislate reality into stability.	Enforcer of Fate: you impose a measurable order on the board, making the chaotic fracture behave as a system again.	Stabilizes outcomes; prevents runaway stacking; creates reliable win lines through structure.	Suppresses improvisation; punishes creativity and variance; risks turning heroism into compliance and removing the exceptional.	Movement/displacement that breaks formations; sacrifice engines that ignore restrictions by converting loss into gain.	Marble geometry; gold scales; clean sigils; straight beams of light; locking runes; crisp chimes; orderly UI frames.	EXACTLY/ONLY; FORMATION; QUOTA; CENSURE; SILENCE; MEASURE; DECREE
Path of Descent	Katabasis	Katabasis of the Due Toll	Nothing is gained without passage.	Katabasis insists Fate broke because endings were evaded and losses were denied. Meaning returns only when power has a price: sacrifice, destruction, and debt paid in blood, time, or certainty. It repairs the fracture by making every gain accountable—turning ruin into fuel and inevitability into advantage.	Destroy-for-benefit; death triggers; delayed payoff; conversion (gain destroyed power); global toll counters; debuffs tied to sacrifice; token creation from death; suppression of death-prevention.	Inevitability; sacrifice; consequence; underworld law; solemn commerce of lives; the truth that all victories must be paid.	Auditor of Fate: you restore meaning by forcing costs, transforming loss into leverage, and proving that unpriced power cannot endure.	Stops “free value”; restores consequence; makes the board state meaningful through irreversible decisions.	Can spiral into cruelty and optimization of sacrifice; makes collateral acceptable; risks normalizing destruction as routine.	Silence/edict effects that disable engines; movement that denies targets and disrupts planned sacrifices.	Obsidian and ash; green underflame; coin glint; drifting cinders; grave-bloom motes; slow sinking animations; toll marks.	DESTROY; OFFER; DEBT; REQUIEM; HARVEST; FINALITY; GRAVE-BLOOM
Way of Motion	Kinesis	Kinesis of the Ever-Turning Way	What does not move, breaks.	Kinesis claims Fate shattered when paths froze—roles ossified, borders hardened, power stagnated. The cure is movement: displacement, reshaping, and refusing permanence. It repairs the world by keeping everything in circulation, making control temporary and momentum decisive.	Move/self-move; displace enemy; swap/relay; momentum checks (moved this turn); temporary locks (vanishing path); reactive reposition; buffs tied to motion and empty space.	Change; flux; liminality; messenger roads; tides and revels; freedom as necessity; impermanence as truth.	Pathbreaker of Fate: you exploit fracture-lines, break territorial certainty, and win by making positions unreliable and timing decisive.	Prevents stagnation; breaks entrenched control; creates new lines of play through relocation and tempo.	Erodes commitment and stability; undermines ownership; can make victories feel fleeting and sacred things unguardable.	Formation locks and anti-move rules; destruction engines that profit from constant churn and attrition.	Wind streaks; wave arcs; feather trails; ripple distortions; quick lateral motion; blink transitions; swirling highlights.	MOVE; DISPLACE; RELAY; SHIFT; SLIPSTREAM; MOMENTUM; VANISHING-PATH
